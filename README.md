Files for 3D printing recording setup for NHP neuropixels. 

This repo has everything you need to 3D print recording grids / drives for NHP long neuropixels. Designs were done in OnShape and the whole workflow actually depends on OnShape. 

Here is the master design document: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/92b490f11a9de5cea640da10/w/0255b94daf661036b5cbaa1c/e/1ceffa4d5fb554f0a61c65cf
